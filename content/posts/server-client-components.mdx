## A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from the /blog path to https://example.com?" Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.

Hello there,

Thanks for reaching out o the Versel, hope you're doing well!

To set up a redirect from the /blog please use a serverless function. Here is an example using Node.js with Vercel:

To create a serverless function, create a file named redirect.js in the api directoryand add the following code:

```html
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/blog') {
    res.writeHead(301, { Location: 'https://example.com' });
    res.end();
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Not Found');
  }
};
```

This code checks if the request URL is /blog and redirects it to https://example.com with a 301 status code, indicating a permanent redirect. For other paths, it returns a 404 status.

Thanks and regards,

## A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.


Hello there,

Thanks for reaching out o the Versel, hope you're doing well!

To prevent your project from being indexed by search engines, you can add a robots.txt file and a meta tag to your site's HTML. Here's how you can do it:

Create a robots.txt file, add the following content to a file named robots.txt at the root of your site:

```html
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

Add a meta tag to your HTML, include the following meta tag in the head section of your HTML:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

These steps will instruct search engines not to index your site. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Thanks and regards,
Kaustubh D.

## What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

>  One of the most common problems customers ask Vercel for help with is deployment issues, including build failures or configuration problems. I think improved documentation will help to overcome common problems, in both the short-term and long-term. We can also develop an AI-based tool that can analyze the error statement, fetch similar tickets from the past and suggest a possible solution. 

## How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?

>  Provide step-by-step, interactive tutorials. A chat feature for real-time assistance. Building a user community so that user can share and discuss their solutions.
