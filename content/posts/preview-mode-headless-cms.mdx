## Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?

>  I will ask about the language and framework or technology that is being used. I'll also ask for the error message or a screenshot if any.

>  I'll look for the material / docs available with the Vercel it'd be very helpful if I found a sample repo related to that language framework. Further, I'll try to replicate the behavior and find out the solution accordingly. I'll also seek a help / suggestions from team or a TL.

## The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below:

>  I’d like to offer sincere apologies for the issue you’re facing. We were trying to replicate this behavior at our end, also please let me know the steps you've already taken it will help ensure we don't repeat any troubleshooting. I also suggest a collaborative debugging session over this topic it’ll help us to expedite the resolution time.
