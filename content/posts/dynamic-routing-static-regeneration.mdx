## What do you want to learn or do more of at work?

>  Incidents might block the customers. I want to learn how to calm a furious customer, with them and handle escalations more effectively. Currently, I handle complex tech queries escalated from L1 and L2 support.

## Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role (preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was successful?

>  Recently I got a ticket from an Australian customer where he was unable to access his web application hosted in a docker container on his local system.

>  To access the local apps from LambdaTest we need to use a tunnel functionality, but the customer had made changes in his host file instead of localhost he was using gl.localhost and pointing it to his docker IP.

>  After triaging this I came to know that the LambdaTest tunnel was recognizing gl.localhost as a subdomain of localhost which was pointed to 127.0.0.1 and as nothing was running hence it was throwing an error 404.

>  These were the customer’s system-level changes and had nothing to do with the LT product it needed multiple screen-sharing sessions with the customer. But somehow we managed to provide them a solution.

>  Instead of gl.localhost we suggested gl-localhost which was a standalone domain and not a subdomain of localhost. After trying this on our local system we mailed this to the customer and after following up with the customer we got a confirmation with a smile. And the issue got resolved.

## When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?

1. Serverless Functions 
>  Is for standard backend logic and API endpoints, ideal for Data processing, database operations, and authentication. When a client is near the server geographically and somewhat latency is accepted.

2. Edge Functions 
>  When a use case is use case is ultra-low latency responses and cold start time is low. This is possible because Google’s V8 engine and servers are deployed at the edge of the internet over multiple geographical locations.

3. Edge Middleware
>  It is used when either we need to alter the cache request headers or redirect to different pages.This is useful for AB testing.
