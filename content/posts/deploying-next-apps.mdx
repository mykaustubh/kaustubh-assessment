## Most favourites

1.  Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project
>   Once a customer buys a product it is very important to make them believe that Vercel's job is not only building tech solutions but also creating customers who can create new customers. Troubleshooting their project will not only improve our engagement with the customer but also help us understand the latest customer use cases. It might be good product feedback too. Also. I love to debug.

2.  Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub
>   I feel repos are the first point of contact for techies to start the POC. Some people might judge the product if we miss sample repos or documentation. Working on repos will improve my product knowledge and it it'll help to serve the customer better in case of customer queries. If I can example this in terms of LambdaTest if I ran appium-python-robot sample repo it'll help me to understand Robot framework queries.

3.  Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders
>   How we handle incidents plays a very crucial role in customer satisfaction, customer deliveries or regression might be affected because of our downtime. Communicating with them ASAP and updating the status page within minimal time, will reduce the number of chats / tickets / emails which will generate a reaction from customers. Here at LambdaTest CS-Team is very responsible for such communications.

4.  Respond to 25+ support requests via email every day
>   Nothing is more fascinating than having a busy day, imagining starting a day at 8 am and after a blink, it is 7 pm. Making myself so busy with work that I might forget time is satisfying for me. Also, the learning I get from handling high ticket volume will polish my experience. 

5.  Run ticket review sessions to make sure the tone is consistent
>   Introspection is very important in CS, and for this taking sometime to sit on tickets we handled in the past is needed. Our tone should be inclusive of customer empathy and humbleness.

6.  Help train and onboard new support teammates
>   What I learnt in the past 2 years and what mistakes could be avoided it is very important to share with the new joiners. An experience clubbed with documentation will help them to settle very well in the Vercel culture. Responsibility to bring out the best in others is a great cause.

## Least favourites

1.  Help resolve billing issues for customers
>   I think this process can be automated very easily in the future. I can understand for a customer a billing query and a tech query might plays equal importance, but a billing or sales team can handle this more effectively than me.
